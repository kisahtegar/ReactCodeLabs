## ✨ Overview

The **Playground for React TSX** directory is a dedicated space for experimenting with React and TypeScript. This is where we dive into TypeScript concepts, test component ideas, and explore advanced features with the type-safe benefits of TypeScript.

## 🔬 What You'll Find Here

- **React + TypeScript Basics:** Quick experiments with TSX, props, and state.
- **Type Safety:** Examples of typing props, state, and custom hooks for robust components.
- **Advanced Patterns:** Hands-on practice with Context API, HOCs, and Render Props.
- **Performance Testing:** Optimizing React applications with TypeScript.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `react-tsx` directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kisahtegar/react-labs.git
   cd react-labs/playground/react-tsx
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and explore the playground at `http://localhost:3000`.
