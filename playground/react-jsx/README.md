## ✨ Overview

The **Playground for React JSX** directory is a dedicated space for experimenting with React and JavaScript. This is where we dive into React concepts, test component ideas, and explore advanced features using modern JavaScript practices.

## 🔬 What You'll Find Here

- **React Basics:** Quick experiments with JSX, props, and state.
- **JavaScript Integration:** Examples of using JavaScript with React for building dynamic and interactive components.
- **Hooks Exploration:** Hands-on practice with custom and built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
- **Performance Testing:** Trying out memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting to optimize apps.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `react-jsx` directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kisahtegar/react-labs.git
   cd react-labs/playground/react-jsx
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and explore the playground at `http://localhost:3000`.
